Supply Inventory Program

This school project was an assignment to create an inventory system for products and parts.

The scenario was to create a software solution for a company that wants to migrate from a paper system of keeping track of products and parts in their inventory to a computer software system.

The program is user-friendly and includes a GUI for this purpose.
